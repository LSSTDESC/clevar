The Cluster Evaluation Resources (ClEvaR) is a Python library
to validate cluster detection from catalog comparisons.
Its main goal is to provide a framework for easy matching of catalogs,
and compute the main metrics and scaling relations.
This library has been developed in the LSST context,
to be used on the current simulations and on the upcoming cluster detections,
but can also be used with any set of catalogs.


The source code is publically available at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/ClEvaR
